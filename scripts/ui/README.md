Smartface UI Editor will use this folder to generate output JavaScript files to be used in app.

Those files are auto generated from /ui folder and placed under /scripts/ui folder.

Do not modify content of auto generated files within this folder. Modified content might be lost, overwritten by the auto generation process on any time. Smartface is not responsible for such possible loss.

You can use those generated files via require and perform your modifications after.
